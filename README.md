# WDI PROJECT 1

##Outline
This is a typing game that chooses words at random from large arrays, introduces those words to the window at random intervals, speeds and positions for the user to type before they hit the floor.

For each correctly inputted letter, the user is awarded a point and that letter is removed from the current word until the word, and its bubble, disappears.

As you work through the levels, the enviroment changes as well as being presented with increasingly difficuly words at escalating speeds.

##Brief
This project was designed to build on skills we had been taught in the first two weeks of the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.

The idea was to build a game using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.

##Result
I am very pleased with what I achieved over the period of one week after having only been exposed to programming for two weeks. The game works smoothly and is I think it has an aesthetic design that changes over the three levels.
